# SimpleUI
## This is (or rather will be soon) a simple App to play with TB

The app will:

###V1: Initial setup
* Allow me to choose a nick (no authentication!)
* Allow me to define 'friends' (a friend is simply another nick)
* Each of the friends that we have defined will be able to contact us if they
  choose. They can, of course, add us back as friend (and thus we can also
  contact them).

###V2: Actual communication
* When we initiate a connection, the remote user will be notified and he can
  choose to accept or reject the connection. If he accepts, then a WebRTC
  connection is established.
